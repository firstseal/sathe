## Help Myself

- Exercise
    > Exercise is very beneficial for myself. I usually feel great afterwards/

- Taking Meds
    > Not sure why I keep forgetting but I usually feel amazing after taking my meds

- Eating Healthy
    > Feel real good eating healthy, and lose some weight (eating disorder :c)

- Journaling
    > Good to journal my thoughts and keep track of my life. This helps me relieve stress and express my thoughts.

- Being kind to others
    > Being nice to my friends makes me feel nice (dopamine rush / surge)

- Avoid Social Media
    > Using social media is bad for my anxiety and makes me overwhelmed / overstimulated. Luckily, I don't have many major forms of social media, and I try not to use them- though all my friends and everyone I know uses social media. Hard for me.

- Drink Water
    > Again, drinking water helps my brain and keep me going woo.

- Small walks
    > Small short walks help clear my thoughts, release stress and help me focus

- Stare at a far away object
    > Focusing at an object far away can help me focus and relieve stress and anxiety.

- Listen to music
    > Listening to music can be beneficial for my mood. I have to be careful what I listen to because I am easily motivated by music. Usually Lofi and Binural beats is good for me. Synthwave is good, and Nightcore is great background music for when i'm doing certain tasks. **Warning** - *music affects my behavior EXTREMELY. BE CAUTIOUS*.

- Get up and stand
    > Every 45 minutes I should get up out of my chair (assuming im sitting) and walk around.

- Cool Temperature
    > I do not function well in high temperature areas. I like it cool.

- Clear my enviroment
    > I cannot work in a messy enviroment with distractions. I work best in an empty white room with nothing to distract me.

- Read Books
    > Reading books. I love doing this but it's extremely difficult for me to focus. I need to read in a calm area with NO distractions. Usually have to take Ritalin and listen to Brain.fm to focus for a bit.

- To Do lists
    > TODO LISTS ARE AWESOME. Remembering to use them is difficult. I use my Remarkable Tablet. I try to set this out in an area I use every day.
        > Update!! Been using Todoist. Very good.

- Form Habits
    > I do better getting up every day at the same time and doing the same thing every day. I can't let my schedule slip.

- Avoid Alcohol
    > I do enjoy alcohol but it usually causes me 3 days to recover. Quit drinking alone. People make fun of me for that. How do they know though?

- Posture
    > I have an issue where there isn't enough blood going to my brain. On top of this, my spine and neck is curving. Bad posture is actually why a lot of people die. Good posture will improve a lot of my issues. Headaches would go away, more blood to my brain.

- Sedating myself
    > Sedating myself at night is beneficial. Keeps my calm during the day. No or almost none anxiety.

- Taking Meds in certain order
    > I need to take M1 right when I wake up, and after I eat and maybe some studying, take M2. M3 & M4 as-needed. M5 & M6 should be used under certain circumstances.
