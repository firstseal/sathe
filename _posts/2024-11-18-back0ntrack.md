Should get back on track. It's been a bit since I journaled stuff, especially within my Remarkable. I thought of getting the Remarkable Pro, not entirely sure though. I have the urge to buy stuff, though I probably shouldn't. I actually just bought a Keychron keyboard and another monitor. Supposedly the Whoop 5.0 is coming out soon, around black friday. I sure hope so, because I want to buy that. Need to get back to watching Mr. Robot. I've seen it plenty of times, and plan on seeing it plenty more. On top of that, my money is going up yay. I am becoming super human. Bought a device which sends electric signals into my body to stimulate my muscles and such. Should relieve pain and soreness. I like this type of year. oh i got distracted and don't remember what all i was say ing. Oakay then. Gonna play soem fallout
