## Health & Fitness

- [Whoop](https://whoop.com)

I use Whoop every single day and it's absolutely amazing. It never leaves my wrist, and that's what makes it perfect. Unlike a smartwatch, you have to remove it to charge it, with Whoop, the charger attaches right on your wrist. I honestly even forget i'm wearing it.

### Brain

> More-so for "brain"-related things such as supplements, cognitive enhancements, etc.

- [BrainFM](https://brain.fm)

BrainFM is music that is scientifically proven to help increase focus. I find it to be absolutely amazing. I always use this when i'm studying and I honestly think it helps me a lot. I'm actually able to get in a deep focus with this and I really struggle with that.



## Privacy & Security
