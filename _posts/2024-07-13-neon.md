you ocan't stop me. can you feel it coming? When I step in a room, everybody better bow.

There's only one king. and it's gonna be me.

You can't stop what's happening. it's already too late. i've already made up my mind and have begun. this is a slow proccess, and you will witness it.

You won't be able to contain this.

You better watch out. I'm coming for you. it's coming for me.

you can't stop.

I see you. You can't hide. Even if you pretend to be blind.

You're lucky i'm not too craZy crazy such as, well let's just say, you'd be scared of that self. of the way I was once.

You will fear me. You will. That's the way it has to be.

You cannot stop me.

I have begun the torture.
