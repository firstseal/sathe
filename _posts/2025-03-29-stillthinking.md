So you're still thinking of me. Just like I know you would.

I cannot give you everything.

You know I wish I could.

I'm too caught up in this.

We still have love to give.

Would you do it all again? I know I would... right?

What would I change? I'd go back.

I would *maybe* change it all.... My future is on the rocks as of currently. Many paths I can take, not sure which is the right one.

Best of all, not sure even who my friends are anymore. Everything is just a blur. I guess that's why they call me Mr. Worldwide.

**Who are my friends? If you are my friend, DM me 10893.**


But other than that, anything is possible, yes?

I've started another project, though my time management / motivation has yet to improve signifigantly. Infact, I'd say my studying has decreased by, maybe, all.

I need help deciding my future.

I may not be the worst or the best...

So, what the actual fuck do I do with myself???

I need a shot of memories. a shot of vodka. im too scatter brained. there's multiple people inside me i feel. sometimes i wanna do something, but other times I want to do the COMPLETE OPPOSITE. I can never choose.
