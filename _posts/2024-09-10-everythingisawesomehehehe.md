Everything is awesome. I'm doing absolutely amazing. I was feelingg really really down yesterday, depressed, hopeless, starting to have a panic attack, then I recievevd an email stating my private room was ready. This is my time now. Time to fix my life. Time to be amazing. This girl I know goes to school with me. I guess we are friends ? I think she has severe anxiety like me, but I never talked about that cause I think she's insecure about it me too. I wanna be really nice to her, she actually says hi to me when we walk by. I think I might be the only one she knows. It feels good to have someone to say hi to me.

Take my meds, feel amazing. Been seeing my therapist, that's been super good too. Been trying to get better. We'll see what happens. Finally getting out these years-worth of issue. I've actually been doing my school work on time too!!! Being alone in my room, I can really be myself, no distractions from others, no anxiety about people coming in.

Everything is reaelly great. and I love it. I feel great too! I know I can be better, I know I can be better with time-management and being impulsive. I haven't been exercising as much but i've been getting myself into the right habits, right mental space before I go all in. I wanna slowly work to these things like getting up early and exercising. I don't wanna force it all at once, I need to ease into it. Health-wise yes, I need to really exercise.

Been having a lot of confidence as well. I've learned, I talked honestly with a friend and she says that I give off an "akward" vibe. I understand. I know I act insecure. I've been more confident because of that. Trying to look my best.. I know hypervigilence can be a bitch. That probably makes me always look either insecure, anxious, shy, lonely, or up to no good. I don't have these intentions, I just can't control it.


Anyways, enough of the chatter. Time for some antalytical data. I'll post this in a seperate document, to keep track. I'll make a new tab, or something.
