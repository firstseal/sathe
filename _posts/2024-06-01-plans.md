Hello. We have a lot of unfinished work that has to be done. We need to develop a strict regiment to increase overall productivity & efficiency.
Along with that, it is crucial to continue with our check-ins and whatnot. Consistently monitoring biometric data can help us identify various trends and patterns with behavior. We have to start waking up at 3AM again. It's for our best well-interest. I'll send over a few resources to help us achieve our goal. I think we both know what's going on here. The brain has never been this clear before. I see everything, past, present, and future.

I'm wide awake.
