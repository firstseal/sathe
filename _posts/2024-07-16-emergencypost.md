It is time to explain various things. I have finally found a fix to my erratic behavior, and now it is time to begin focus on my projects that I had to temporary. put on pause after my friend had passed. Since his passing, I have gone down the rabbit hole with my health. It took me a while to realize I was inside the hole, deep. I have been analyzing various things I have been involved with in the past, with me competing in various national cybersecurity events and whatnot.

There was a bug in my brain- something that did not allow "good" to exist. I figured out this bug. I have done some discovery. I know remember everything. Everything is clear now. I have to resume my work on the internet "self-defense" guide I have created to help people in-need. It was completely irresponsible of me to let this project fail, as there were peoples who lives depended on this, to evade censorship from authoritarian regimes.

Along with this- I have decided that I will be seeking professional attention for.s issues.

Essentially, everything will go back to the way it was. Just me and you. Working on projects. I have always done to help others. I have failed. I went down into a spiral. It is time for me to escape the waters. I am not in water anymore. I am free. Everything is clear to me now. It is time to resume.

I do not exactly remember where I left off, but it had something to do with various vitamins essential for health. I recall either I was not getting enough or too much testosterone and / or estrogen. I do not exactly recall where I have acquired this information, but it does not seem to be extremely urgent at this moment. The only major issue I have to overcome with is my professional career. Because of my mental downfall, my professional career has also escaped away.

Anyways, it was good to see everybody once more. Please do be aware, I will be active. I will be determined to catch up. I am years behind but this will not stop me.

Yours truly,

~
