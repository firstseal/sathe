## Remnote

[Remnote](https://remnote.com) is an absolutely amazing platform for keeping notes, planning and studying. It's able to turn your notes into flashcards. It also uses spaced repetition to improve the efficiency and knowledge retention of the material you are wishing to learn.

Currently, I am using the [Dracula Theme](https://github.com/drstrangez0/Remnote-Dracula-theme) and I am using custom CSS for my favorite font- `Cosmic Neue`:

```
div {
        font-family: 'Comic Neue';
        font-size: 1em;
        src: url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Comic+Neue&display=swap');
}
```

On top of that, I am using a variety of plugins. Not going to list them all here but you get the point. Here's some additional resources for Remnote:

## Speechify

[Speechify](https://speechify.com/) is an absolutely amazing service. It uses AI and voice actors to read text for you. This is absolutely amazing if you have ADHD or have difficulties reading. I try to use it for literally everything. It's absolutely amazing. It even allows you to read faster by gradually increasing the speed of the narrator. On top of that, you can even use custom voices and make your own!

## BrainFM

[Brain.FM](https://brain.fm) is an awesome tool I use for studying. They create music that is [scientifically proven](https://www.brain.fm/science) to increase focus. There is a [paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.01.462777v1) about it too. I find that this actually does help with me focusing. Any time I have to get work done, I listen to this. I even listen to it while i'm sleeping as well!!

## ToDo Lists

I very much enjoy [Todoist](https://todoist.com) as my todo list. I'm able to have it auto sync to all my devices (even my watch), and am able to even sync it into Remnote. It makes keeping track of stuff a TON easier.. I mean I guess that was my fault, considering that I would just write it down or just forget it all completely.
