It'sss greeeat.

Sleep recovery / stats been down. Likely due to pain and alcohol consumption.

Exercise has increased.

RHR and HRV decreased as well.

RHR increased.

Blood pressure decreased. Caffiene intake decreased.

Sugar intake decreased.

Need to work on sleep and recovery. 25mg of sedatives should put me back in my place into green recovery. Need a lower RHR. Gained a few lbs. Will likely drop by tomorrow (water bloat?).

More statistical updates will be posted in the future. This is a general rundown on what I have to improve upon.

Using Sauna blanket along with Sleep time music (brainfm and binural beats and whatnot.)

Been using massage device on left scapula as well due to levoscoliosis. Need to go to PT. Forgot.

Been taking 800? or 1000? or 2000? or 400? mg of something for the pain. I got to get the numbers straight. Not good me.

Better sleep = better everything. Sleep will improve. Sleep has been shown to improve with sedatives. I shall do more testing.
