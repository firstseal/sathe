I don't feel real. I feel really sad for some reason. I was happy, i dont know why im sad now. I feel like im sad because of something, but i dont know what. Everything feels fake. I am just in so much pain. Everywhere hurts. I can't even do anything. I don't know what to do with myself. I don't know what to do. Nobody likes me. Everything is just in my head. There's so much I need to do but nobody ever helps me. I can't do this alone.

I can't do this alone.
