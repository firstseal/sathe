Since stopping my meds, my RHR has actually decreased. Along with this, I firmly believe that my thoughts are now clear and concise. I believe the barrier has been removed. It is good to be back. To be my old self. A new version of myself. One that combines the past with the future. I've been hard at work on various projects that we have been doing in the background for years. I've always been a part of myself.

Anyways, we shall meet again.
