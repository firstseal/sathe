Feeling real wired right now.. Saw my therapist yesterday, guess it was good? I did have a good day last night.
I've been sedating myself every night at 20:00, doing such as given me a 90%+ recovery score. Drank a bunch of that special mushroom stuff today. Feeling real wired.

I feel like I have a billion things to do.. but im not sure how to describe it. Like i wanna do it, i just... ugh i feel like im done for the week. i don know.

been getting better tho!! new meds and whatnot which is a real plus!. hehehe.

Was gonna clean today.. or wait. Clean today, laundry tomorrow :)
