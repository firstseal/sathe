*A list of things that i've found to be useful for productivity. I probably use most of the things listed here.*


- [BrainFM](https://brain.fm)

BrainFM is music that is scientifically proven to help increase focus. I find it to be absolutely amazing. I always use this when i'm studying and I honestly think it helps me a lot. I'm actually able to get in a deep focus with this and I really struggle with that.

- [Speechify](https://speechify.com)

Read text aloud, and helps increase reading speed. I find it extremely useful, I can listen to Mr. Beat or Dwight read my books. It's quite amazing actually.

- [Remarkable Tablet](https://remarkable.com)

An e-ink tablet. No distractions.

- [Remnote](https://remnote.com)

Productivity note taking. Better then anything i've used so far, especially with Anki integration.
